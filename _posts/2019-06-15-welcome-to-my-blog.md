**Hello and welcome to my blog!** This post is part of a series of blog posts where I'll be documenting my Google Summer of Code 2019 experience. I'm working at the Hydra Ecosystem organization developing a set of tools with Python to build the future of descriptive Web APIs! Now, if you didn't understand any of this but you found the concept interesting, first head to [https://www.hydraecosystem.org/](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/) and read some introduction materials :)

### Hydra Ecosystem and GSoC'19

Now to the real deal. [Our community](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs) has currently different tools including: A working server that can be built from a Hydra Doc, [*a.k.a hydrus*](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus). Also, we have a [PoC* Python Agent](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydra-python-agent) to work with that server, a.k.a Hydra Agent. I'm currently in charge of developing the Python Hydra Agent to take it from being a PoC to a Pre-Alpha release supporting all basic operations of a Hydra Agent.

### First weeks of GSoC'19

The Agent is has this name for a good reason. Actually, the Hydra Specification and hydrus are awesome things, but more than that, they actually enable a new type of APIs Clients, Smart Clients or *Smart Agents*. This is a big and important step for the Hydra Ecosystem because it will allows a whole new level of Clients. They which can process and interpret APIs by themselves, retrieving information in a universally standard way!
